You're probably familiar with the feeling: a programmer in your vicinity or online just doesn't seem to get your point of view. Even though there's no doubt they are _clearly_ wrong. These kinds of encounters make you feel misunderstood, frustrated, yes, even angry.

I, too, deal with these feelings on a regular basis. I read a tweet and think to myself: they are so wrong. I get angry because of the misinformation that's spread, the anti-patterns that are promoted, the lack of understanding.

I've had some insights in these kinds of situations though, and I want to share these with you today. I won't be able to tell you who's wrong or right — if there even is such a thing — and it will also take an effort on your part to succeed.

The payoff? A better understanding of why your colleague or that one guy on Reddit thinks such different thoughts than you, as well as a better grip on such circumstances. It allows you to rise above conflicts, become a problem solver instead of a troublemaker.

In this post I'll share a mental framework for programmers to manage these kinds of conflicts. To do that, we'll need a simplified example.

Let's imagine two types of programmers: builders and architects.

If you ever had to work in teams; in school, as your job or in hobby projects; you're probably familiar with these two types of people.

The first ones, the builders, are the programmers who get things done. They work efficiently. Besides their daytime job, they come up with these amazing side projects and to the outside world it looks like writing code comes naturally to them.

On the other hand there are architects. They are concerned about sturdy and structurally sound code. They spend hours, sometimes days, debating the right way to solve a problem.

These two types of programmers seem like opposites. They themselves look at the other group and often think exactly that: we have such a different way of handling the same problems. Our solutions are so different, they can't both be right, or so it seems. 

Builders often find architects too rigid and conservative. They follow the rules for the sake of following them, without any practical benefit. Architects, in turn think of builders as careless, too focused on results, instead of thinking about long-term maintainability.

This tension often leads to confrontations between the groups, at the office or online; and interestingly enough, these kinds of discussions only focus on trying to convince the other side of your point of view. I've been guilty of this myself more than I can count.

What's fascinating about these kinds of situations though, is that people from both sides almost never seem to realise there's strength in their differences.

Instead of focusing on what they disagree on, let's try another approach: let's, for a minute, try to support the other party. Mind you: not just agree with them for the sake of ending a discussion, but actually trying to help them solve their problem, with your skillset.

Here's how that looks: while architects enjoy abstract thinking, they often have difficulties putting their thoughts into practice: they run into problems they didn't anticipate for or the actual implementation takes too long and they loose their drive. On the other hand, builders actually enjoy working towards a clear goal, they find energy in a project taking shape. So let's sit them down, together, and combine their strengths.

The illustration is easy enough — right? Though professional programmers still fall in the trap of endless discussions way too often.

Almost every individual likes to think that the world around them thinks exactly the same way they do — that's simple human nature. When the reality proves that's not the case, conflicts arise.

When you become aware of this personality trait, both in yourself and in others, you can use that knowledge to both your advantage. It's a reality that most people won't have the same vision as you do, they think differently. It's better to embrace that reality instead of fighting it. 

One framework which differentiates between all kinds of personality types is called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator — MBTI for short. It differentiates between 16 types of personalities. Obviously every person is unique, but those 16 types give an indication of how you and your colleagues think, how you'll react to situations, how you'll handle problems.

Having this knowledge about yourself and your co-workers allows for better team dynamics. At my previous job we did the test with around 25 colleagues. We sat down one afternoon to talk about the results. Not only did the majority of people recognise themselves in their profile, it also exposed struggles and hidden frustrations that were never shared before, because no one knew how to deal with them. Now we did.

If you want to know your own MBTI profile, you can test it for free! There's a great website called [16personalities.com](*https://www.16personalities.com/) providing the test for free. I'm interested to see the results! Let me know your profile and check up on others on [twitter](*https://twitter.com/brendt_gd).
