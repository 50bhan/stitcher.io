My wife and I are what I would call casual couch gamers. We enjoy an evening of Switch games when our son's asleep. Nothing too serious.

Actuallyâ€¦ We have been rather serious about this Minecraft Dungeons game for the past two weeks or so. We've been grinding away collecting more and better gear, trying to level as fast as possible, and honestly having a great time while at it.

I never expected us to have such a great experience, it's truly a wonderful game. So today I want to share some of our joy with you! 

So Minecraft dungeons â€” MCD for short â€” is a adventure role playing, dungeon crawler kind of game: you play dungeons, to collect more gear, to play more dungeons, to level up, â€¦ you get the point, right?

There is some kind of story line, but honestly you'd be disappointed if you're buying this game just for the story. It can be summarized like so â€” be careful spoilers ahead â€” there's a villain who you have to defeat in the final level.

That's basically it ðŸ˜…

So, luckily, the story line isn't what makes MCD great. It's actually the grinding and constantly advancing to play more difficult dungeons. It's strangely addictive, to be honest.
