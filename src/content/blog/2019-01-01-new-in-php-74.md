## Short closures <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arrow_functions_v2)</small>

Short closures allow for less verbose one-liner functions.

```php
<hljs prop>array_map</hljs>(function (<hljs type>User</hljs> $user) { 
    return $user->id; 
}, $users)
```

```php
<hljs prop>array_map</hljs>(<hljs keyword>fn</hljs>(<hljs type>User</hljs> $user) <hljs keyword>=></hljs> $user->id, $users)
```

A few notes about short closures:

- They can access the parent scope, there's no need for the `use` keyword.
- `$this` is available just like normal closures.
- Short closures may only contain one line, which is also the return statement.

You can read about them in depth [here](*/blog/short-closures-in-php).

## Typed properties <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/typed_properties_v2)</small>

Class variables can be type hinted:

```php
class A
{
    public string $name;
    
    public Foo $foo;
}
```

## Improved type variance <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/covariant-returns-and-contravariant-parameters)</small>

I wrote about PHP's type system in [the past](*/blog/what-php-can-be),
so it's good to see some improvements are actually arriving in PHP's core.

Type variance is a topic [worth its own blog post](*/blog/liskov-and-type-safety); 
in short: you'll be able use covariant return types…

```php
class ParentType {}
class ChildType extends ParentType {}

class A
{
    public function covariantReturnTypes(): ParentType
    { /* … */ }
}

class B extends A
{
    public function covariantReturnTypes(): ChildType
    { /* … */ }
}
``` 

… and contravariant arguments.

```php
class A
{
    public function contraVariantArguments(ChildType $type)
    { /* … */ }
}

class B extends A
{
    public function contraVariantArguments(ParentType $type)
    { /* … */ }
}
```

## Null coalescing assignment operator <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null_coalesce_equal_operator)</small>

Instead of doing this:

```php
$data['date'] = $data['date'] ?? new DateTime();
```

You can do this:

```php
$data['date'] ??= new DateTime();
```

## Array spread operator <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/spread_operator_for_array)</small>

It's now possible to use the spread operator in arrays:

```php
$arrayA = [1, 2, 3];

$arrayB = [4, 5];

$result = [0, ...$arrayA, ...$arrayB, 6 ,7];

// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

Note that this only works with arrays with numerical keys.

## Foreign function interface <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/ffi)</small>

Foreign Function Interface, FFI in short, allows calling C code from userland.
This means that PHP extensions can be written in pure PHP.

It should be noted that this is a complex topic.
You still need C knowledge to be able to correctly use this feature.

## Preloading <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload)</small>

Preloading is an amazing addition to PHP's core, 
which can result in some major performance improvements.

In short: if you're using a framework today, 
its files have to be loaded and recompiled on every request.
Preloading allows the server to load PHP files in memory on startup, 
and have them permanently available to all subsequent requests.

The performance gain comes of course with a cost: 
if the source of preloaded files are changed, the server has to be restarted.

## Custom object serialization <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/custom_object_serialization)</small>

This RFC adds two new magic methods: `__serialize` and `__unserialize`. 
The difference between these methods and `__sleep` and `__wakeup` is discussed in the RFC.

## Concatenation precedence <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/concatenation_precedence)</small>

If you'd write something like this:

```php
echo "sum: " . $a + $b;
```

PHP would previously interpret it like this:

```php
echo ("sum: " . $a) + $b;
```

PHP 8 will make it so that it's interpreted like this:

```php
echo "sum :" . ($a + $b);
```

PHP 7.4 adds a deprecation warning when encountering an unparenthesized expression containing an '.' before a '+' or '-'.

## RFC voting process improvements

This is technically not an update related to PHP 7.4, though it's worth mentioning:
the voting rules for RFC's have been changed.

- They always need a [2/3 majority](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/abolish-narrow-margins) in order to pass.
- There are not more short voting periods, all RFCs must be open for at least [2 weeks](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/abolish-short-votes).

## Reflection for references <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/reference_reflection)</small>

Libraries like Symfony's var dumper rely heavily on the reflection API to reliably dump a variable.
Previously, no proper reflection support for references was available, 
causing these libraries to rely on hacks to detect references.

PHP 7.4 adds the `ReflectionReference` class which solves this issue.

## `mb_str_split` added <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mb_str_split)</small>

This function provides the same functionality as `str_split`, but on multi byte strings.

## `ext-hash` always enabled <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/permanent_hash_ext)</small>

As the title says, this extension is now permanently available in all PHP installations.

## PEAR not enabled by default <small>[EXTERNALS](*https://externals.io/message/103977)</small>

Because PEAR isn't actively maintained anymore, the core team decided to remove its default installation with PHP 7.4.

## Password Hashing Registry <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/password_registry)</small>

Internal changes to how hashing libraries are used, so that it's easier for userland to use them.

## Deprecate `ext/wwdx` <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate-and-remove-ext-wddx)</small>

This data exchange format was never standardised, and now its extension is deprecated.

## Short PHP tags deprecated <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_php_short_tags)</small>

The short open tag `<?` has been deprecated and will be removed in PHP 8. 
The short echo tag `<?=` is unaffected.

## Left-associative ternary operator deprecation <small>[RFC](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/ternary_associativity)</small>

The ternary operator has [some weird quirks](*/blog/shorthand-comparisons-in-php#ternary-operator) in PHP. 
This RFC adds a deprecation for nested ternary statements. 
In PHP 8, this deprecation will be converted to a compile time error.

```php
1 ? 2 : 3 ? 4 : 5;   // deprecated
(1 ? 2 : 3) ? 4 : 5; // ok
```

## Backward incompatible changes <small>[UPGRADING](*https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-7.4/UPGRADING)</small>

You should always take a look at the full [UPGRADING document](*https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-7.4/UPGRADING) 
when upgrading PHP versions.

Here are some of the backward incompatible changes highlighted:

- Calling `var_dump` on a `DateTime` or `DateTimeImmutable` instance will no longer 
leave behind accessible properties on the object.
- `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes` will throw an exception in error situations.
- Attempting to serialise a `PDO` or `PDOStatement` instance will generate 
an `Exception` instead of a `PDOException`.
- Calling `get_object_vars()` on an `ArrayObject` instance will return
the properties of the `ArrayObject` itself, and not the values of the wrapped array or object.
Note that `(array)` casts are not affected.
