Being a programmer, I often listen to music during work. When one of my colleagues suggested I should listen to the famous "Hamilton" musical tracks, I wasn't sure I would actually like it. 

Nevertheless I gave it a shot, and boy was I wrong. It even got me so interested in the American Revolution, that I started to look around for podcasts about it.

## Revelation

After some trial and error, I stumbled upon Mike Duncan's [Revolutions Podcast](*https://www.revolutionspodcast.com/). Again I wasn't sure this would actually be "my thing", but somehow the short 20 minute episodes and Mike's calm voice grabbed my attention.

Next I knew I was binge listening a history podcast about the American Revolution, with the songs of Hamilton stuck in my head.

I think "Revolutions" is a great example of where contents beats form. There's no fancy sound effects or heavy editing. There's just a guy who knows very well what he's talking about, and is able to talk about it in such a way that you're immersed into the story.

By now, Revolutions has 10 seasons, each of them covering a specific revolution. You're perfectly able to choose a season, but you do need to listen it as a whole.

If history is your thing, or if you're not sure about it yet, you should give Revolutions a try!
