My wife and I are what I would call casual couch gamers. We enjoy an evening of Switch games when our son's asleep. Nothing too serious.

Actuallyâ€¦ We have been rather serious about this Minecraft Dungeons game for the past two weeks or so. We've been grinding away collecting more and better gear, trying to level as fast as possible, and honestly having a great time while at it.

I never expected us to have such a great experience, it's truly a wonderful game. So today I want to share some of our joy with you! 

So Minecraft dungeons â€” MCD for short â€” is a adventure role playing, dungeon crawler kind of game: you play dungeons, to collect more gear, to play more dungeons, to level up, â€¦ you get the point, right?

There is some kind of story line, but honestly you'd be disappointed if you're buying this game just for the story. It can be summarized like so (careful, spoilers ahead): there's a villain who you have to defeat in the final level.

That's basically it ðŸ˜…

So, luckily, the story line isn't what makes MCD great. It's actually the grinding and constantly advancing to play more difficult dungeons. It's strangely addictive, to be honest.

## A basic rundown

The mechanics of the game are rather simple: every character has a melee and ranged attack, as well as three special abilities called artifacts.

Each artifact has its own effect, ranging from healing yourself and team mates, stunning enemies, special buffs , etc. You can pick and choose whatever artifacts you want, if you manage to find them during your dungeon runs, of course.

Besides artifacts you gather three types of gear items: a melee weapon, a ranged weapon and armor. Note that it's entirely up to you how you build your character: there's no predefined classes that you have to choose from. You can very well have a tank and ranged DPS build for the same character, and switch between fights. 

I would say that's actually a good thing, because depending on the amount of people you play with, there are cases where you'd need to switch classes. For example: if you're leveling solo, you wouldn't make it very far with a purely DPS focused build, you'd need to be able to take some hits and heal yourself. If you're playing co-op on the other hand, responsibilities can be split between players.

Finally each gear item can be enchanted. An enchantment can make a weapon stronger, add special effects like pulling enemies towards you, allow bows to have multi shot, etc.

Each item can have up to three enchantments, but
