PHP 7.4 will probably be released somewhere December 2019.

## Preloading <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload)</small>

Preloading is an amazing addition to PHP's core, 
which can result in some major performance improvements.

In short: if you're using a framework today, 
its files have to be loaded and recompiled on every request.
Preloading allows the server to load PHP files in memory on startup, 
and have them permanently available to all subsequent requests.

The performance gain comes of course with a cost: 
if the source of preloaded files are changed, the server has to be restarted.

## Typed properties <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/typed_properties_v2)</small>

Class variables can be type hinted:

```php
class A
{
    public string $name;
    
    public Foo $foo;
}
```

This RFC has been accepted, but is not yet merged; we're not yet 100% certain yet it'll end up in PHP 7.4.

## Improved type variance <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/covariant-returns-and-contravariant-parameters)</small>

I wrote about PHP's type system in [the past](*http://stitcher.io.test/blog/what-php-can-be),
so it's good to see some improvements are actually arriving in PHP's core.

Type variance is a topic [worth its own blog post](*http://stitcher.io.test/blog/liskov-and-type-safety); 
in short: you'll be able use covariant return types…

```php
class ParentType {}
class ChildType extends ParentType {}

class A
{
    public function covariantReturnTypes(): ParentType
    { /* … */ }
}

class B extends A
{
    public function covariantReturnTypes(): ChildType
    { /* … */ }
}
``` 

… and contravariant arguments.

```php
class A
{
    public function contraVariantArguments(ChildType $type)
    { /* … */ }
}

class B extends A
{
    public function contraVariantArguments(ParentType $type)
    { /* … */ }
}
```

## Null Coalescing Assignment Operator <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null_coalesce_equal_operator)</small>

Instead of doing this:

```php
$requestData['date'] = $data['date'] ?? new DateTime();
```

You can do this:

```php
$requestData['date'] ??= new DateTime();
```

This RFC has been accepted, but is not yet merged; we're not yet 100% certain yet it'll end up in PHP 7.4.

## Foreign Function Interface <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/ffi)</small>

Foreign Function Interface, FFI in short, allows calling C code from userland.
This means that PHP extensions can be written in pure PHP.

It should be noted that this is a complex topic.
You still need C knowledge to be able to correctly use this feature.

## `ext-hash` always enabled <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/permanent_hash_ext)</small>

As the title says, this extension is now permanently available in all PHP installations.
