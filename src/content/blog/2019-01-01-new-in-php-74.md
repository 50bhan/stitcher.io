PHP 7.4 will probably be released somewhere December 2019.
This page will receive regular updates meanwhile. 
Last update was January 14, 2019

## Preloading <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload)</small>

Preloading is an amazing addition to PHP's core, 
which can result in some major performance improvements.

In short: if you're using a framework today, 
its files have to be loaded and recompiled on every request.
Preloading allows the server to load PHP files in memory on startup, 
and have them permanently available to all subsequent requests.

The performance gain comes of course with a cost: 
if the source of preloaded files are changed, the server has to be restarted.

## Typed properties <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/typed_properties_v2)</small>

Class variables can be type hinted:

```php
class A
{
    public string $name;
    
    public Foo $foo;
}
```

Update 07-01: As of now, typed properties are merged, and thus confirmed for PHP 7.4.

## Improved type variance <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/covariant-returns-and-contravariant-parameters)</small>

I wrote about PHP's type system in [the past](*/blog/what-php-can-be),
so it's good to see some improvements are actually arriving in PHP's core.

Type variance is a topic [worth its own blog post](*/blog/liskov-and-type-safety); 
in short: you'll be able use covariant return types…

```php
class ParentType {}
class ChildType extends ParentType {}

class A
{
    public function covariantReturnTypes(): ParentType
    { /* … */ }
}

class B extends A
{
    public function covariantReturnTypes(): ChildType
    { /* … */ }
}
``` 

… and contravariant arguments.

```php
class A
{
    public function contraVariantArguments(ChildType $type)
    { /* … */ }
}

class B extends A
{
    public function contraVariantArguments(ParentType $type)
    { /* … */ }
}
```

Update 14-01: The RFC is currently in the voting phase, but it looks like it'll pass without any problems.

## Foreign Function Interface <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/ffi)</small>

Foreign Function Interface, FFI in short, allows calling C code from userland.
This means that PHP extensions can be written in pure PHP.

It should be noted that this is a complex topic.
You still need C knowledge to be able to correctly use this feature.


## Null Coalescing Assignment Operator <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null_coalesce_equal_operator)</small>

Instead of doing this:

```php
$data['date'] = $data['date'] ?? new DateTime();
```

You can do this:

```php
$data['date'] ??= new DateTime();
```

Update 14-01: [Tomas Votruba](*https://www.tomasvotruba.cz/) pointed out that the original creator of the RFC 
isn't able to finish the implementation. 
Question is if someone of the PHP core team will be able to pick it up.
You can read more about it [here](*https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/1795#issuecomment-425748467). 

## `ext-hash` always enabled <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/permanent_hash_ext)</small>

As the title says, this extension is now permanently available in all PHP installations.

## Password Hashing Registry <small>[rfc](*https://wiki.php.net/rfc/password_registry)</small>

Internal changes to how hashing libraries are used, so that it's easier for userland to use them.
