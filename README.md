# Stitcher

High performance, static websites for PHP developers.

```bash
composer create-project pageon/stitcher
```

Stitcher is more than a static site generator. It's a tool which helps developers creating very high performance websites.
 One of the core features of Stitcher is of course the static generator, but there's also:
  
- Built-in SASS support
- Twig and Smarty support
- Automatic image optimization, as easy as `image.srcset`
- Markdown, YAML and JSON formats
- JavaScript and CSS minification
- Data set overviews and details; pagination, sorting and filtering
- Meta tag configuration

You can read more about it on [the Stitcher website](http://stitcher.pageon.be).

### Upcoming features

Stitcher is in alpha development, so new features are still being made. Here's a list of what's to come before a stable v1 release:

- Plugin support
- Config includes
- Public file configuration
- Theme support
- Limit adapter
- More meta helper functions

Also, we're already thinking about the farther future:

- Localisation
- URL generation
- CLI Configuration and setup
- site:deploy command
- Frontend Filters
- Form support with Lumen/Slim
